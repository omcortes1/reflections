1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
What happens is that opens a hidden directory called .git where all the
meta-data of the history of the files is going to be stored. It DOES NOT create the first commit for you.
Why need to do it in order to start saving the metadata in that part. I don't know!!!

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is were all the drafts of changes are. This is a transient space between the working directory and the repository.
The Working directory does not have the history information or metadata.
The process is like this
working directory --(add file 1)-->staging area --(just one commit for all)--> repository
                  --(add file_N)-->
